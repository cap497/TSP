# TSP

This repository analyzes the Travelling Salesman Problem and the following algorithms to solve it:

- Brute Force
- Branch-and-Bound
- Twice-Around-the-Tree
- Christofides'

This repository contains:

- TSP Python Notebook
- Data Samples: small, medium, large, huge
- Results Metrics CSV
- PDF Paper

Small, medium and large data contains randomly generated instances.

Huge data contains TSPLIB 95 instances with a wide range of number of nodes.

TSPLIB 95 is a library that contains multiple samples of various TSP related problems.

Only instances using 2D Euclidian coordinates were chosen.

Approximate algorithms are compared to TSPLIB 95 bounds.

Notebook can be used to generate random instances and/or test other TSPLIB instances.
