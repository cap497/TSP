# TSP

This repository analyzes the Travelling Salesman Problem and the following algorithms to solve it:

- Brute Force
- Branch-and-Bound
- Twice-Around-the-Tree
- Christofides'

This repository contains:

- TSP Python Notebook
- Data Samples: small, medium, large, huge
- Results Metrics CSV
- PDF Paper

Small, medium and large data contains randomly generated instances and huge contains TSPLIB 95 ones.

TSPLIB 95 is a library that contains multiple samples of various TSP related problems.

This is only a concise selection of TSP instances using 2D Euclidian coordinates chosen to evaluate algorihms with an increasing number of nodes.

Notebook can be used to generate random instances and/or test other TSPLIB instances.
