# TSP

This repository analyzes the Travelling Salesman Problem and the following algorithms to solve it:

- Brute Force
- Branch-and-Bound
- Twice-Around-the-Tree
- Christofides'

This repository contains:

- TSP Python notebook
- Data samples: small, medium, large, huge
- Results: CSV and metrics graphs
- PDF paper

Small, medium and large data contains randomly generated instances.
- Due to lack of smaller instances in TSPLIB

Huge data contains instances from TSPLIB 95.
- TSPLIB contains multiple samples of various TSP related problems
- This is only a handpicked selection of TSP instances using 2D Euclidian coordinates
- This selection was chosen to evaluate algorihms with the increasing number of nodes

Notebook can be used to generate random instances and/or test other TSPLIB instances.
